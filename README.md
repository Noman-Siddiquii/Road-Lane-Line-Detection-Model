# Road Lane Line Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting road lane lines using deep learning techniques. Utilizing the TuSimple dataset, we aim to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying lane lines in various road conditions. The final model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the UNET architecture, implemented with TensorFlow, achieving an accuracy of 95%.

## Business Understanding
Accurate lane detection is a critical component for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). It ensures that vehicles can safely navigate by staying within lane boundaries, thus preventing accidents. This project aims to create a reliable lane detection system that can function effectively in diverse driving conditions, including different road types and weather scenarios.

## Data Understanding
The TuSimple dataset used in this project contains annotated images of road lanes. Key features include:

- **Image Frames**: High-resolution images capturing various road scenarios.
- **Lane Markings**: Annotations indicating the positions of lane lines in the images.

## Modeling and Evaluation
The project employs a CNN-based approach with the UNET architecture for lane detection. Key steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Involves normalization, resizing, and augmentation of the input images.
2. **Model Architecture**: The UNET architecture, known for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks, is utilized to identify lane markings.
3. **Training and Validation**: The model is trained on the TuSimple dataset with TensorFlow.

### Model Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 95% accuracy achieved on the test set.

## Conclusion
The road lane line detection model developed in this project demonstrates significant accuracy and reliability. The use of the TuSimple dataset and the UNET architecture has proven effective in identifying lane lines in various road conditions. Future work will focus on enhancing the model's robustness, especially in challenging scenarios like poor lighting or heavy traffic.
